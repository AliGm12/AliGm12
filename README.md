### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Ali Golmaryami, and I'm a frontend developer with a keen passion for web development in any form. I enjoy crafting harmonious, user-first interfaces and have a talent for taking an idea and transforming it into a working, pleasing one.

**Iâ€™m currently working on React.Js, TypeScript and Next.Js.**

#### I'm in the process of becoming a TypeScript (TS) and React.js expert at the moment. Staying current with new technology and trends is a must for me, and I'm convinced continuous learning is paramount in a high-tech environment such as in this one.
